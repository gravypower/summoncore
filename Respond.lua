-- Respond: how Zennit deals with a summon of him, and the dice.
--
-- When a live summon of Zennit reaches his client, a dialog gives him four choices (the same choices are in the
-- hub window's Zennit tab):
--   Accept          the summon counts.
--   Decline         the summon does not count; free or not by one rule (Respond.NoResult), the same as the game's own Decline.
--   50 silver       the summon counts once he says the silver was paid ("owes" until then).
--   Dice            he rolls 1-100 (a real /roll, so the party sees it); the summoner is asked to roll back;
--                   Zennit adds 10 to his roll (a little less or more as the season's catch-up moves it), higher wins and a tie goes to him. If he wins, the summon does not count.
-- His answer is stored on the event and sent to everyone (message Z); only his own client can answer for him.
-- The dice use messages D (his roll, to the summoner) and S (the summoner's roll, back to him).
