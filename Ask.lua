-- Ask: the state of Zennit, read by his own client. Nothing is put to him and he presses nothing: his client looks and answers.
-- Questions only Zennit's client can answer (design/lenses.md, Parked ideas: the stranded summons). Is his hearthstone ready?
-- Is he carrying something? How long has he been logged in? Anyone asks; the question goes to the group and the guild, and only his
-- client answers, whispering back to whoever asked. No rule uses an answer yet: this is the mechanism a challenge or a card
-- could play later (Ask.Ask takes a callback for that). He is told each time he is asked, and /sc zennit ask off stops answers.
--
-- A question: key = { label, arg (what the argument is, if it takes one), about(arg) -> what was asked, for his notice,
-- answer(arg) -> status, value (his client), say(value, arg) -> the fact as a sentence (the asker's client) }. A status is "ok", "unknown" (the game would not say), "off"
-- (he has switched them off) or "unasked" (his client does not know the key). Values are short strings, never trusted for more
-- than what they say.
