-- Reset: wipes the summons, the badges and, with them, the story (the season is worked out from the log).
-- It asks first. The admin can also ask everyone else to reset (/sc reset all): each user is shown a prompt and
-- nothing is changed on their client until they agree. A reset leaves a mark (db.resetAt); anything older than it
-- is refused by sync, so another client still holding the old log cannot put it back. A reset everyone was asked to make
-- is also kept as db.resetAll, which every hello passes on (Sync), so a client that missed the request is asked later;
-- a friend's own reset stays on their client.
