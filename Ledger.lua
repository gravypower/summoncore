-- Ledger: "The Index today", the part of the story that follows the season. The intro's ten fixed scenes are
-- narrated and drawn once; this is the last scene of them, written fresh from the season tree every time it plays:
-- who leads, how far down each trunk the race has got (only chapters already reached, so nothing is spoiled),
-- how the season ended before this one, and how this week stands. Build is pure (state in, sentences out) so it
-- can be tried without the game; State reads the live season.

-- (Media/ledger/<id>.ogg, with its length in LedgerClips.lua). tools/intro/build_ledger_audio.py renders the clips from
-- this table, so keep every entry a single string on one line. The lines that carry a name or a number are built
-- below and stay typed and silent. The exception is the week's whim: there are four, each a fixed sentence with a rule's
-- number in it (Week.WHIMS), so each is recorded as the whole line; it plays only while the line the scene builds is
-- still word for word that one (see Ledger.WhimClip), and a self-test fails when a rule change makes a recording stale.
